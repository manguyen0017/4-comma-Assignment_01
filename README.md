<!-- Abstract -->
## Abstract
A satirical showcase of generative AI’s tendency to misinterpret human intent, often overcorrecting or hallucinating unexpected results. It explores the gap between AI’s unbiased, early-state responses and human expectations, highlighting issues like bias, subjective prompt failure, and iterative frustrations in AI-driven creative tools.

Example of how to make a list:
There are many great README templates available on GitHub.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

## Introduction and Related Works

Generative AI tools have become widely used for art, text generation, and creative workflows, yet they often struggle with misinterpretation, overcorrection, and unintended distortions. This issue is particularly evident in AI image generation, where users must refine prompts iteratively to achieve desired results—often encountering unexpected biases, distortions, or hallucinations in the process.

AI hallucinations occur when generative models fabricate information that does not exist or distort elements in an unpredictable way ("Artificial Intelligence Hallucinations")—a common frustration among artists attempting to refine AI-generated visuals. These inaccuracies force users into an iterative correction loop, tweaking prompts in hopes of fixing errors, yet often causing new ones ("How Do People React to AI Failure?").

Moreover, research suggests that AI failures are not only a technical issue but also a psychological one, as users frequently overestimate AI’s intelligence and expect human-like reasoning from systems that rely solely on mathematical probability ("AI Oversight and Human Mistakes..."). This mismatch between user intent and AI response creates a frustrating, yet humorous, struggle—one that this project aims to capture through satirical storytelling.

Here I talk about how these works have paved the way for my project. Recent research shows that sense of belonging is evoked when using mixed realty [1], and my work is inspired by this xyz. Another recent project examines the beauty of symmetry in evolution [2] that my work highlights in my 4-comma cell number 4. 
Notable work by Kamp in 2019, highlights the beauty that could be found in nature and how it connects to design [3] and my work show the influence of that visual in 4-comma cell number 3. 


This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

## Methodology

[![4-comma][images-fig3]](https://example.com)

To execute this project, each panel will be generated individually to allow greater control over style, consistency, and AI hallucinations. The main challenges in AI-generated comics include:

* Maintaining art/comic style consistency across all panels.
* Controlling "unwanted" distortions (hallucinations like extra limbs).
* Ensuring coherence in visual storytelling (consistent character appearance, proportions, and scene layout).
